Collection of classes to access public API's

This is a collection of reusable php classes to connect to public api's at service providers. For instance: connect to PRTG servers or connect to Domain Registries. There is no standardization in using these classes yet. First i'd like to add most of the classes that i personally use and later on standardize.
